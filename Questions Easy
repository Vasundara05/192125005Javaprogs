Find the nth odd number after n odd number
Sample Input: N : 7
Pseudo 
User to enter input ‘n’ for which you want to generate n odd numbers. Let us take n=3
We enter the for loop  for(i=1;i<=2*n;i++) where i is your counter.
1st Iteration for(i=1;i<=2*n;i++) i.e. for(i=1;i<=6;i++)
if (i%2==0) it is false as 1%2!=0 so we print i.    i = 1
2nd Iteration for(i=2;i<=2*n;i++) i.e. for(i=2;i<=6;i++)
if(i%2==0) it is true as 2%2=0 hence 0==0 so we do not print i and just continue that is skip the below part.
3rd Iteration for(i=3;i<=2*n;i++) i.e. for(i=3;i<=6;i++)
if (i%2==0) it is false as 3%2!=0 so we  print i.  i=3
4th Iteration for(i=4;i<=2*n;i++) i.e. for(i=4;i<=6;i++)
if(i%2==0) it is true as 4%2=0 hence 0==0 so we do not print i and just continue that is skip the below part.
5th Iteration for(i=5;i<=2*n;i++) i.e. for(i=5;i<=6;i++)
if (i%2==0) it is false as 5%2!=0 so we print i.  i=5
6th Iteration for(i=6;i<=2*n;i++) i.e. for(i=6;i<=6;i++)
if(i%2==0) it is true as 6%2=0 hence 0==0 so we do not print i and just continue that is skip the below part.
Now i=7 but 7>=6 so our program ends

Sample Output:
Hence the values printed for i are 1 , 3 , 5.
Test cases:
N = 0
N = -6
N = 2021
N = -14.5
N = -196
